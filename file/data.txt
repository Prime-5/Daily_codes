char ch;  
ch=f.get()				//Read a character from file  
f.put(ch)				  //Write a character in file

char word[10];
f>>word;				  //Read a word from the file.
f<<word;				  //Write a word in the file.

char line[100];
f.getline(line,100);			                      //Read a string from file. (Reads till it meets the delimiter)
f.putline(line);			                          //Write a string in the file.
f<<"Type a string here to put in file";         //Write a string in a file.

f.read() 				  //Read data from a binary file
f.write()				  //Write data in a binary file
